**Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship in Cancer**:

Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) is an efficient computational approach widely used in drug discovery. QSAR aims to develop a mathematical relationship between compounds and their activity. By analyzing this relationship, researchers can predict the activity of new compounds from their structure. The core benefit of such computational approaches is the reduction of the need for extensive experimental testing. QSAR is particularly used in the development of cancer therapeutics wherein it helps streamlining the drug discovery process.

In the context of cancer drug discovery, QSAR plays a vital role by identifying potential drug candidates from a pool of compounds. These candidates can target specific pathways and proteins that express in cancer. Cancer is a highly complex heterogenous disease comprising cell proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis, so precise targeting of molecules is important. Through QSAR, we can predict how structural modifications in compounds can enhance or inhibit their activity against cancer cells. 

Although the steps may vary in different settings, the general QSAR process consists of the following steps. Compound data, including chemical structures and biological activities (e.g., inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) values) is collected from various sources, such as, ChEMBL database. In the next step, descriptors, which are numerical values representing various chemical properties of the compounds, are calculated. These descriptors represent a set of properties such as molecular weight, hydrophobicity (LogP), number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and more. Machine learning algorithms, such as multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), or neural networks are employed to correlate these descriptors with biological activities. A predictive model is created on these descriptors.

An example of using QSAR in cancer drug discovery is in the development of inhibitors for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EFGR is a protein that is overexpressed in various cancers such as non-small cell lung cancer. New EFGR inhibitors as cancer therapeutics have been identified using QSAR models by predicting their activity based on their chemical structure. This has accelerated the identification of potent drug candidates for further experimental testing.

They used molecular fingerprints as a descriptor type because of its ability to extensively label structural properties of compounds using mathematical values. Their QSAR model can be used as a filter to screen potent compounds against ER alpha receptors in breast cancer.&#x20;

QSAR is a robust tool in cancer drug discovery that enables the efficient prediction of compound activity and development of new therapeutic agents. The main benefit of using QSAR is that it employs computational power for a vast chemical data, thus reducing time and cost associated with drug development.
